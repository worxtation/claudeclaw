<p align="center"><b>A lightweight, open-source OpenClaw version built into your Claude Code.</b></p>

ClaudeClaw turns your Claude Code into a personal assistant that never sleeps. It runs as a background daemon, executing tasks on a schedule, responding to messages on Telegram and Discord, transcribing voice commands, and integrating with any service you need.

> Note: Please don't use ClaudeClaw for hacking any bank system or doing any illegal activities. Thank you.

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add worxtation/claudeclaw
claude plugin install claudeclaw
```
Then open a Claude Code session and run:
```
/claudeclaw:start

## FAQ

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Can ClaudeClaw do &lt;something&gt;?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    If Claude Code can do it, ClaudeClaw can do it too. ClaudeClaw adds cron jobs,
    heartbeats, and Telegram/Discord bridges on top. You can also give your ClaudeClaw new
    skills and teach it custom workflows.
  </p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Is this project breaking Anthropic ToS?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    No. ClaudeClaw is local usage inside the Claude Code ecosystem. It wraps Claude Code
    directly and does not require third-party OAuth outside that flow.
    If you build your own scripts to do the same thing, it would be the same.
  </p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Will Anthropic sue you for building ClaudeClaw?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I hope not.
  </p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Are you ready to change this project name?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    If it bothers Anthropic, I might rename it to OpenClawd. Not sure yet.
